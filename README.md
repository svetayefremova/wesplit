# wesplit

This project was created during the process of learning SwiftUI.

## Achieved:

In this project I learned about the basic structure of SwiftUI apps, how to build forms and sections,
creating navigation views and navigation bar titles, how to store program state with the @State property wrapper,
how to create user interface controls like TextField and Picker, and how to create views in a loop using ForEach.
